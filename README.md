GameGuru is a 3D game maker everyone can use to make their own simple First Person and Third Person games and is available to buy from Steam or direct from The Game Creators. For the first few years of its life, development was managed by a small team of coders, and as the list of features grew, so did the community who found it a great alternative to more serious and professional game making solutions.

Starting 2018, it was determined that progress could be considerably improved if the engine code was hosted on the cloud so more coders, moderators, technical artists and content creators could collaborate to speed up the creation and testing of features. Thanks to GitHub, the new repository would also benefit from an issues tracker which could consolidate bug reports, feature requests and everything between onto a single delivery system.

If you are only interested in making a 3D game without the coding, you can buy GameGuru right now and skip the rest of this introduction, but if you are interested in diving into the very source code of the engine, adding features, fixing bugs, building up the asset libraries or documentation, then this is the place for you. Welcome to unprecedented access to the very heart of GameGuru, take full control of your game making journey or sit back and enjoy up to date news on the day to day developments of what could be your favorite 3D game maker.
